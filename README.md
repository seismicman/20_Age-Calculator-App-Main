## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I developed this chalenge in React using components and CSS for the styles. It was so useful to understand the HTML elements as section, articles, input text and button.

Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

Regarding the functionality of this challenge in react, I used three components: "Card", "Inputs" and "Results". Also a custom hook "useform" and two functions to validate and caculate the dates. With the value of these parameters I used conditional rendering to show the elements and error messages.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, Bootstrap, Tailwind among others.
